# Club Sula Official Web Page

This is a project for the official webpage for the Sula Table Tennis Club located in Honduras, San Pedro Sula. This takes an aproach to both their structure as a company and also their unity as a sports team.

## Content

This project contains the react app for the web page as well as the reaact components it is build with. Most of the indivual components can be reused in a general scope. No dependencies are required for they are made only using CSS and JS.

The project can be divided into the following categories:
-Home
-Team
-Events
-Services
-Contact Info
-Editing Interface

Given the necesity for the administrators of the webpage to update its content, a separate interface was developed where they can interact with the database hosted in Firebase where they are able to add, erase or edit events, players or staff.
